# HTML-CSS_Cheat-Sheet

(2/21/2023) (8:24 AM CST | UTC/GMT -6 hours)
This is a project which is required in Codecademy's curiculum. The project requires a cheat-sheet to be developed using the HTML and CSS that has been taught to showcase
what the developer is capable of thus far. This is my code thus far into the project. I'd say I'm quite close to finishing.
I've finished the vast majority of the HTML doc, and am now just working on the CSS to give it some beauty. Any advice is much invited and equally as appreciated!
I'd love any input on thoughts, concerns, suggestions, etc. Feel free and do not hesitate to give constructive criticism! Thank you!
